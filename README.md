######**Hand Written digit Identifier**#########

SVM offers very high accuracy compared to other classifiers such as logistic regression, and decision trees.  Very good in handling nonlinear input spaces. 
Used in a variety of applications such as face detection, intrusion detection, classification of emails, news articles and web pages, classification of genes, and handwriting recognition.
in this scenario uses svm to recognize the hand written digts (0 to 9) and also aplication devaloped by using python tkinter.



****Pre-requisites****** 

  1. Python 3.6 
  2. OpenCV 
  3. numpy
  4. matplotlib
  5. scikit-learn

****Improvements can be made*****

  1. If we use more imgaes rather than this sklearn dataset acccuracy can be improved.
  2. Can use nural network instead of using svm.
